## :pencil: Descriptioin


This is the first project in Software Engineer Immersive program at General Assembly. My choice of brower-base game is called Spaceman. Spaceman is a game variant of the popular game hangman, where one player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by guessing letters. Each incorrect guess brings you closer to being "hanged." This game helps to sharpen spelling and word-decoding skills. In Spaceman, the concept is the same, but instead of being "hanged", you are a man in space in danger of a UFO snatching you away! Each incorrect guess will draw part of the UFO out and eventually kidnap you if you used up all 6 attempts!
